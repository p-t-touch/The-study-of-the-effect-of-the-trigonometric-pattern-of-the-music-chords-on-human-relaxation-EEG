Abstract 

This objective of this research is for study of the effect of the trigonometric pattern of all of the music chords 
and study about the relationship of class in Moonlight Sonata. Furthermore, we compared the effect on human relaxation 
in the different type of the chords to explain the music that lead to human relaxation in mathematics and biology. 
The different type of the music is Major chords, Minor chords and mix. We use Geogebra program to search for the trigonometric 
relationship and the intersection on the frequency wave of the note in different chords. Moreover, we recorded 
and analyzed the result from EEG for 10 persons from Princess Chulabhorn Science High School Pathum Thani at the laboratory, 
Mahidol University. The variable is the change of Alpha wave in each area in human brain. For the result, 
there is the intersection of the three different waves in the same point. When we count for the length of the Major chords in each wave
, we can find that there is the pattern in 2, 2.5 and 3 cycles, respectively. However, in Minor chords, 
we can find that there is the pattern in 8, 9.5 and 12 cycles, respectively. Also, for the music in each class, 
there are some relationship in music and mathematics. Lastly, for the hypothesis, 
the most of music that is a big change of alpha wave is Moonlight Sonata. 

Keywords: music chords, the pattern of trigonometric, relaxation and brain wave
